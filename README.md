# WebScraper
My first python webscrapper

I used python and the bs4 & urllib libraries to create a simple webscraper to scrape data from newegg.com
The script grabs the Brand name, Product name, Shipping price, And the Current price of a page of Server Memory Cards
and then saves them into a csv file.
